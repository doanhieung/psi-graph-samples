# PSI Graph Samples

## Introduction

This repository contains **sample** Printable String Information (PSI) graphs. These graphs represent the relationships between functions in executable files that contain printable strings. PSI graphs are useful for detecting IoT botnets and analyzing function-call patterns. These samples are provided as a reference but are not the full data used in the original research.
